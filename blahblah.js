Got it 👍 Let’s break it down clearly.

In JavaScript, the logical operators ||, &&, and ! are used for combining or negating conditions.

1. OR (||)

The OR operator returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.

Example:
let a = true;
let b = false;

console.log(a || b);  // true (because a is true)
console.log(false || false); // false (both are false)


👉 Usage: Often used in if statements when you want to allow multiple valid conditions.

let age = 20;

if (age < 18 || age > 60) {
  console.log("Discount applies!");
}

2. NOR (! (A || B))

JavaScript doesn’t have a direct NOR operator, but you can create it using NOT (!) and OR (||).

NOR means "Not OR" → true only if both conditions are false.

Example:
let a = false;
let b = false;

console.log(!(a || b)); // true (since both are false)
console.log(!(true || false)); // false


👉 Usage: Often when you want to check that none of the conditions are true.

let loggedIn = false;
let isAdmin = false;

if (!(loggedIn || isAdmin)) {
  console.log("Access denied!");
}


✅ Summary:

A || B → true if at least one is true.

!(A || B) → true only if both are false (NOR).
