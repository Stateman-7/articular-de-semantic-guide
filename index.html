                          <P>I love programming</br>    
<i>Programming</i> is the art of giving instructions to a <strong>computer</strong> to solve problems.</br>
It combines logic, creativity, and precision to build applications and systems.</br>
From simple scripts to comlex algorithms, it powers the digital world.</br>
Programming transforms ideas into functional, real word solutions.</br>
It is not just about code, but about creating possibilities.
